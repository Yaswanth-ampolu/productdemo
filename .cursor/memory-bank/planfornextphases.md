# Plan for Next Phases: AI Agentic Platform for Chip Design

## Vision Overview

The Platform Dashboard is evolving into an AI agentic platform specifically designed for chip design professionals. This platform will enable users to interact with an AI assistant through a chat interface, which can understand chip design contexts, execute commands on behalf of users, and assist with complex Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows.

## Core Purpose

To create a powerful, context-aware AI assistant that can:
1. Understand chip design terminology and workflows
2. Execute commands on users' machines or remote servers
3. Automate repetitive tasks in the chip design process
4. Provide intelligent assistance through natural language interaction
5. Learn from user interactions to continuously improve

## Technical Architecture Evolution

The current platform will be extended with the following components:
