# Active Context: Migration Completed & Ollama AI Integration

## Current Status
The platform migration to a unified architecture has been successfully completed. All 19 steps of the migration plan have been executed, resulting in a streamlined architecture where the Express backend serves both the API endpoints and the frontend static files.

## Migration Summary
- Removed Vite and related dependencies
- Configured React Scripts for frontend builds
- Updated Express to serve static files from client/build
- Prefixed all API routes with `/api`
- Centralized configuration in config.ini
- Fixed SPA routing with path.resolve() for proper path handling
- Updated all documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Current Focus
We are now focusing on implementing Phase 3: AI Integration Foundation, specifically the Ollama AI server integration. This integration will allow administrators to configure connection settings for local Ollama servers and sync available models.

## Key Components for Ollama Integration

### Backend
- `src/services/ollamaService.js`: Main service handling Ollama API communication
  - Gets/updates settings from database
  - Tests connection to Ollama server
  - Syncs models with database
  - Sends messages to Ollama models
- `src/routes/ollama.js`: API endpoints for Ollama functionality
  - Admin-only routes for settings and model management
  - Private routes for message generation

### Frontend  
- `client/src/components/settings/OllamaSettings.tsx`: Admin settings UI
  - Server configuration (host, port, default model)
  - Connection testing
  - Model sync and management
- `client/src/services/ollamaService.ts`: Frontend service for API communication
  - Interface definitions
  - API request handling

### Database
- `ollama_settings` table: Stores server connection details
- `ai_models` table: Stores available models (synced from Ollama)

## Current Issues with Ollama Integration
1. Authentication failures when accessing admin-only routes
2. Connection test failures to Ollama server
3. TypeScript errors in frontend components
4. API routing issues with incorrect endpoints

## Immediate Tasks
1. Fix authentication flow for admin users
2. Update API service to use correct endpoints and authentication
3. Test connection to Ollama server with proper credentials
4. Verify model sync functionality

## Security Considerations
- Admin-only access for sensitive settings
- Private access for message generation
- Connection validation before saving settings
- Proper API route protection with /api prefix

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Data Refresh Strategy**
   - Deciding between polling vs. WebSockets for real-time updates
   - Balancing data freshness with server load
   - Considering caching strategies for frequently accessed data

2. **User Experience Refinements**
   - Evaluating loading states and skeleton screens
   - Considering animation strategy for transitions
   - Planning error handling and user feedback mechanisms

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Implementing CSRF protection
   - Considering rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Planning audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Designing secure command execution framework for AI agent

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Using the new unified architecture for simpler deployment
   - Planning CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Using centralized configuration for environment-specific settings
   
5. **Database Performance**
   - Monitoring query performance with PostgreSQL tools
   - Optimizing complex queries with proper indexing
   - Considering when to use database functions vs. application logic
   - Leveraging PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB and triggers

6. **AI Integration Strategy**
   - Evaluating Ollama hosting requirements
   - Considering model selection and configuration approach
   - Planning conversation context management
   - Designing secure agent execution framework
   - Implementing modular AI components with dedicated sub-files
   - Creating user-friendly model selection interface

7. **Project Organization**
   - Backend files and scripts organized in src directory
   - SQL scripts centralized in src/scripts/sql
   - Documentation maintained in documentation directory
   - Code structure follows established patterns
   - Frontend static files served from client/build

## Active Development Context

### Current Focus
The team is currently working on:

1. Developing the admin user management interface
2. Completing the chat interface UI components
3. Implementing Ollama AI integration:
   - Created backend API endpoints for Ollama settings
   - Built admin settings UI for Ollama configuration
   - Developed model selection component
   - Integrated AI chat processing hook
   - Need to update Chatbot.tsx to use AI integration
   - Need to apply database migration scripts

### Recent Completions
- âœ… Completed full migration to unified architecture
- âœ… Fixed SPA fallback route for proper direct URL access
- âœ… Updated all scripts and documentation for the new architecture
- Prepared database migration scripts for `schema_migrations` and `ollama_settings` tables
- Built complete administrative Ollama settings UI
- Created model selector component for the chat interface
- Implemented AI chat message formatting with code block and URL support
- Added backend routes for Ollama settings and model management
- Created frontend service for interacting with Ollama API

### Current Technical Challenges
1. **Database Schema Evolution**:
   - Need to apply migration scripts in the correct order
   - Ensure `schema_migrations` table is created before other migrations
   
2. **Ollama Integration**:
   - Connection to Ollama server fails with both localhost and IP address (172.16.16.26)
   - Default timeout of 15 seconds may be insufficient for connection
   - Test connection fails in the UI despite Ollama server running
   - Unable to save settings or sync models due to connection issues
   - Possible network/firewall issues preventing access to port 11434
   - Need more verbose error logging to diagnose connection failures
   - Model selector in chat interface shows blank state due to lack of sync'd models

3. **Chat UI Integration**:
   - Update Chatbot.tsx to use the ModelSelector component
   - Connect the chat UI with the AI backend services
   - Implement streaming responses (if supported by Ollama)

### Active Files
- `client/src/pages/Chatbot.tsx` - Needs updating to integrate AI
- `client/src/services/chatbotService.ts` - Needs to support model selection
- `src/routes/chatbot.js` - Needs updating to use Ollama models
- `src/scripts/sql/create_schema_migrations.sql` - Ready to apply
- `src/scripts/sql/create_ollama_settings.sql` - Ready to apply after migrations table

### Development Workflow
The current development approach is focused on completing the AI integration with Ollama using the newly unified architecture:

1. Apply database migration scripts
2. Update the chatbot frontend to use the new AI components
3. Enhance the chat backend to communicate with Ollama
4. Test the complete integration flow
5. Document the new AI capabilities 

## Ollama AI Integration Issue (April 18, 2025)

There is a connection issue with the Ollama AI integration. Key findings:

1. The Ollama server is running locally at `localhost:11434` and is accessible (tested via curl).
2. The user is also trying to connect to `172.16.16.26:11434` but having trouble.
3. The connection test in the OllamaSettings component fails despite the server being available.
4. The issue appears to be in how API requests are proxied to the Ollama server.

Possible causes:
- The backend routes for Ollama API are mounted at `/api/ollama/*`
- The settings form has the correct inputs but the connection test is failing
- The default model 'llama3' exists on the local server but isn't getting synced to the database

Next steps:
1. Test direct connectivity between backend and Ollama server
2. Verify backend route handling with the new `/api` prefix
3. Verify backend connectivity to PostgreSQL database for ollama_settings
4. Investigate the networking setup between backend and Ollama service

CORS could be an issue when connecting across different machines or networks.
