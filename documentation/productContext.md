# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Platform Dashboard was created to address the need for a centralized AI agentic platform specifically designed for chip design professionals. As organizations in the semiconductor industry face increasing complexity in design workflows, there's a growing need for intelligent, automated assistance that understands chip design contexts and can execute tasks on behalf of users. This platform fills that gap by providing a modern, AI-powered interface that simplifies complex chip design tasks through natural language interaction and automated command execution.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Complexity in Chip Design Workflows**
   - Simplifies interaction with complex EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools
   - Automates repetitive and error-prone command sequences
   - Provides intelligent assistance for navigating complex design processes
   - Reduces the learning curve for specialized tools and scripts

2. **Inefficient Knowledge Transfer**
   - Captures and centralizes domain knowledge for chip design
   - Enables consistent application of best practices
   - Reduces dependency on scarce expert knowledge
   - Accelerates onboarding of new team members

3. **Manual Task Execution**
   - Automates execution of common tasks and scripts
   - Reduces human error in command syntax and parameters
   - Saves time by handling routine operations
   - Enables focusing on creative and strategic aspects of design

4. **Fragmented Toolchains**
   - Provides unified interface to diverse EDA tools
   - Handles integration between different stages of the design process
   - Manages environment setup and tool configuration
   - Creates cohesive workflows across disparate systems

## How It Should Work

1. **AI Interaction Flow**
   - Users connect to the platform through a secure login
   - Interaction occurs through a natural language chat interface
   - AI understands chip design terminology and context
   - Users can request assistance, information, or task execution

2. **Command Execution Process**
   - User describes task or goal in natural language
   - AI formulates a plan with specific commands
   - System presents plan to user for approval
   - Upon approval, AI agent executes commands securely
   - Results are captured and presented back to user

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - System maintains a knowledge base of chip design concepts
   - Context from previous interactions is preserved
   - AI learns from successful command sequences
   - Domain-specific terminology and workflows are understood

4. **Security and Permission Model**
   - Multi-level permissions control command execution
   - Sensitive operations require explicit approval
   - All executed commands are logged for audit
   - Execution occurs in controlled environments

## User Experience Goals

1. **Efficiency**
   - Minimize time spent on routine tasks
   - Automate complex command sequences
   - Provide context-aware assistance
   - Enable rapid problem-solving through AI support

2. **Accessibility**
   - Make complex EDA tools more accessible through natural language
   - Reduce technical barriers to effective chip design
   - Provide clear explanations of processes and results
   - Support users with varying levels of expertise

3. **Learning and Improvement**
   - Help users learn best practices
   - Provide explanations alongside automated processes
   - Capture and share knowledge across teams
   - Continuously improve based on user interactions

4. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly connect with existing chip design workflows
   - Support major EDA tools and environments
   - Enable SSH connectivity to execution environments
   - Facilitate collaborative design through shared context
